•	Tomcat: to run and deploy servlet application.

## Flowcharts of The Application



## Core concepts used in the project. 
•	Object-Oriented: used to create and model objects for users and their credentials.

•	Databases: used to store and retrieve data.

•	Data Sources: used to define a set of properties required to identify and access the database.

•	Collections: used some collections such arraylist to store collection of data. 

•	Exception Handling: used to catch problems that arises in the code especially in I/O blocks.
